while the target audience is everyone, as everyone at some point deals with feeling stressed, I especially catered it to people who have ADHD. In the process of making this project, I wanted to make it something that the past me would have looked at during times of stress and take something from it and feel better.

As a user I want the resources to give me guidance during moments of feeling stressed.

As a user I want to be able to see pictures and other forms of information shown to change up the formula of the website.

As a user, I should be able to navigate around the website without confusion.

As a user, I should be able to access other websites that give me further information should I want it.
### Design
For my wireframe, i opted out to draw it out on a piece of paper.

The color scheme of the website is very basic, with the majority of website being covered in a grey but with the sparks of color to grab the attention of the visitor

Using ChatGPT I implemented some content ( such as the text ) and also learnt how to add Youtube videos to my website and also how to style them.




###Bugs
Some colors that I wanted to implement didn't show up in the website, however this an error that could be fixed fairly quickly as it is most likely due to incorrect CSS code.
The website while fully functional and responsive is slightly off centred.
